# Text_Summarization_NLP
Introducing the NLP Text Summarization Repository. This project, undertaken as part of an internship, employs artificial intelligence to automatically generate concise summaries from large text datasets.

# Dataset
The CNN and Daily Mail dataset from Kaggle is a robust resource designed for training and evaluating machine learning models, particularly in the realm of natural language processing tasks such as text summarization and question answering. This dataset comprises a large collection of news articles sourced from CNN and the Daily Mail, including their corresponding summaries and metadata. Each article is paired with a set of bullet points that highlight key points, providing a rich ground for developing and testing summarization algorithms.
